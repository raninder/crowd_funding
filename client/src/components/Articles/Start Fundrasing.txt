Every year, thousands of highly skilled Veterans enter the job market—ready and eager for civilian work. Yet, 
despite facing labour and skills shortages, employers across sectors often don’t consider Veterans to be a viable talent pool.

Challenge Factory aims to close the gap between Veterans and employers. 
Through their consulting and research, Challenge Factory works to 
1) raise awareness about the benefits of hiring Canada’s Veterans, 
2) give employers tools that will make hiring easier, and 3) draw on Veterans’ knowledge to make sure we get it right.
