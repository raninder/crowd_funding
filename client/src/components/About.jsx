       Parenting a child with special needs is a unique, fulfilling, challenging and heartwarming experience. But, let's face it—it's not cheap. And, there are devices/things that these kids absolutely needs to enhance their quality of life that insurance won't cover. Many people cannot afford these expensive equipment.
     With your amazing support, we aim to help facilitate the donation and transfer of goods and money to families with special needs kids. 
     You can set up your own fundraiser and can make a big difference in a child’s life.
     If your kids are outgrown and have things that can help another family in need, Please donate it using Donate goods feature on our website. 
     Your donation will help open new vistas for special needs children and challenged individuals.
